*A frog can jump up one step at a time, or two...It can also jump to the n level.
*Find out how many ways the frog can jump up n steps.
*/
/*
we can use bp arithmetic to analyze this question.

if n = 3;
this frog jump up 3 steps can arrival terminal;so one way;
2 steps:   one step;
1 steps:   there are 2 steps left,so it's not difficulty to find out there are two ways;
